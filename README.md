# hag
An ncurses procedurally generated dungeon crawler

## Story and History

In our game, A Hag amongst the Glyphs; you play as a nameless adventurer.  You begin the game with almost no skill and a sword so blunt that it literally does not help you defeat enemies at all.  You were quite content with your life as a simple farmer, until one day, an evil Hag descended upon your village and turned all of the surrounding property into a wasteland, including your farm!  You are the only one brave (or stupid) enough to try and take revenge on the hag.  As you progress through the dangerous dungeon, you find and combat enemies of increasing power and ferocity.  You may also find potions and weapons on the journey, which may help you but also may hurt you - so beware!  If you reach the end of the dungeon, you must battle the Hag to the death.  Kill her, and your vengeance is delivered! If you are lucky, maybe you will be able to reverse her magic too.  

The game Rogue is a dungeon crawler adventure game that was initially released in 1980.  Thematically, it was inspired by classic medieval and dungeon crawling media, primarily 'Dungeons and Dragons' and 'Lord of the Rings'.  Some of it's features that you can find in the games of today are: mechanic of permadeath, where your character only has one life and you must start a new game each time you play, and it's mechanic of procedurally generating level layouts, enemy and item placements.  Our game includes both of those mechanics.

In addition, Rogue used the curses library and ascii art in order to represent its game state to the user.  Needless to say, the majority of modern roguelikes have eschewed this type of graphical representation in favor of more modern game development stacks and graphics libraries.  However, we have not done so, and developed our game with the ncurses library and in full compatibility with the C 89 standard.  We have also retained thematic conformity with the norm for the genre, using enemy names only from the high fantasy tradition.  We have also kept our general plot in this tradition as well, as you play as a nameless adventurer delving to the bottom of the dungeon in order to confront an evil monster, where you must overcome a myriad of enemies and grow in your abilities in order to reach the end.
